Navin your sessions are really good and I have learned a lot. I am one of those old-time 80\\'s programmers who started from Fortran, c,c++, java, and now I have learned Python from you. It\\'s interesting how the languages are evolving from one to another, but each is just another step on the ladder. My true feeling is the names are different and syntax are different but the concept is the same from the \\'80s or even older.  But good to learn something new every day.  Thank you, because of you folks I can learn the language quickly compare to my older style of learning (research fo the ebooks, find the best one, order it, and sit and read and parallel try it IDE, longer process), also thank you for addressing the tools required for programming, DBs, and repository. In return If I can contribute to your organization please let me know, once again thank you, team.\\nRead more\\n60\\nREPLY\\nSiddhartha Sarmah\\n1 year ago\\n1.

Navin your sessions are really good and I have learned a lot. I am one of those old-time 80's programmers who started from Fortran, c,c++, java, and now I have learned Python from you. It's interesting how the languages are evolving from one to another, but each is just another step on the ladder. My true feeling is the names are different and syntax are different but the concept is the same from the '80s or even older.  But good to learn something new every day.  Thank you, because of you folks I can learn the language quickly compare to my older style of learning (research fo the ebooks, find the best one, order it, and sit and read and parallel try it IDE, longer process), also thank you for addressing the tools required for programming, DBs, and repository.
